# Summary Report: DevOps on AWS

### Event Objectives
- Present the CI/CD ecosystem on AWS using CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline  
- Introduce Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with CloudFormation and AWS CDK  
- Explain container deployment using Docker, ECR, ECS, EKS, and App Runner  
- Demonstrate how to set up Monitoring and Observability with CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray  
- Share DevOps best practices, case studies, and career pathways  

### Speakers

- **Bao Huynh** - AWS Community Builders 
- **Thinh Nguyen** - AWS Community Builders 
- **Vi Tran** - AWS Community Builders 

### Key Highlights

#### AWS CI/CD Pipeline

- Source Control: CodeCommit  
- Build & Test: CodeBuild pipelines with unit and integration tests  
- Deployment: CodeDeploy supporting Blue/Green, Canary, and Rolling updates  
- Automation: CodePipeline orchestrating the full CI/CD workflow  

#### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- AWS CloudFormation: templates, stack lifecycle, drift detection  
- AWS CDK: constructs, reusable patterns, multi-language support  
- Demo: deploying resources using both CloudFormation and CDK  
- Discussion: choosing the right IaC tool based on project requirements  

#### Container Services on AWS

- Docker fundamentals: containerization and microservices  
- Amazon ECR: image scanning and lifecycle policies  
- Amazon ECS & EKS: orchestration, scaling, service discovery  
- AWS App Runner: simplified container deployment without infrastructure management  

#### Monitoring and Observability

- CloudWatch: metrics, logs, alarms, dashboards  
- AWS X-Ray: distributed tracing and end-to-end performance analysis  

### Key Learnings

#### DevOps accelerates deployment cycles

- Automated CI/CD pipelines reduce errors and speed up releases  
- Blue/Green and Canary deployments lower deployment risks  

#### IaC is the foundation of modern DevOps

- Infrastructure must be defined as code for consistency, auditing, and automation  
- CDK accelerates development through reusable and maintainable constructs  

#### Containerization enables scalable microservices

- ECS/EKS are well-suited for large and complex systems  
- App Runner is ideal for teams prioritizing simplicity and fast deployment  

#### Observability is essential

- CloudWatch + X-Ray provide complete system visibility  
- Proper alerting significantly reduces MTTR  

### Applying to Work

- Implement CodePipeline for automated build–test–deploy workflows  
- Use Blue/Green deployments to minimize downtime  
- Adopt CloudFormation for consistent and auditable infrastructure  
- Create CloudWatch dashboards to monitor service performance  
- Deploy microservices with ECS integrated with CodePipeline for full automation  

### Event Experience

Attending the “DevOps on AWS” event offered valuable real-world insights into applying DevOps in a cloud-native environment.

#### Deep-dive sessions

- Hands-on demos for CI/CD and IaC  
- Clear understanding of the differences among ECS, EKS, and App Runner  

#### Lessons Learned

- DevOps = culture + processes + tools  
- IaC and CI/CD are the core pillars  
- Observability must be implemented from the beginning  
- Containers are the future of application deployment  

> Overall, the event was highly informative, practical, and provided clear direction for advancing a professional DevOps career.
