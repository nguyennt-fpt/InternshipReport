# Report: AI/ML/GenAI on AWS

### Event Objectives

- Introduce an overview of AI/ML and GenAI on AWS.  

- Help participants understand and get hands-on experience with SageMaker and Bedrock.  

- Guide building practical GenAI solutions such as RAG and chatbots.  

### Speakers

- **Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi** - AI Engineer, Renova Cloud
- **Dinh Le Hoang Anh** - Cloud Engineer Trainee, FCJ
- **Lam Tuan Kiet** - Sr DevOps Engineer, Fpt Software
- **Truong Quang Tinh** - Platform Engineer, TymeX

### Key Highlights

#### Prompting techniques for LLMs

- **Zero shot prompting**: the model infers without examples  
- **Few shot prompting**: using a few examples to improve accuracy and consistency  
- **Chain of thought prompting**: guides the model to think step-by-step to improve reasoning  

#### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

- Overview of RAG mechanism  
- RAG use cases: enterprise chatbots, document search, report analysis assistants, technical support  
- How to build a RAG pipeline  

#### Embedding and Amazon Titan Embeddings

- **Embedding**: vector representation of data to help the model understand semantics  
- Applications of embeddings in search, clustering, semantic similarity, and RAG  
- **Amazon Titan Embedding**: high accuracy, optimized for RAG, supports multi-language  

#### Amazon Bedrock

- Bedrock is AWS’s fully managed GenAI platform  
- Supports multiple foundation models and Titan models  
- Provides a unified API and enterprise-level data security  
- Built-in features for Guardrails, RAG, Memory, and Agents  

#### Agentic AI

- AI is evolving from passive responses to **agentic AI**, capable of:  
  - Planning  
  - Goal-oriented actions  
  - Tool calling  
  - Multi-system communication  

#### Bedrock Agent Core

- Agent-centric architecture to run multiple agents at scale  
- Supports:  
  - Routing between agents  
  - Tool calling orchestration  
  - Retrieval integration  
  - Runtime guardrails  

#### Agent Core service enabling agents at scale

- Allows deployment of agents with:  
  - High availability  
  - Scalable worker orchestration  
  - Built-in monitoring and governance  
  - Easy integration with enterprise systems  

### Key Takeaways

#### Prompting

- Zero shot is suitable for simple tasks  
- Few shot improves accuracy in complex tasks  
- Chain of thought helps the model explain and reason better for logical problems  

#### Bedrock and Agentic AI

- Bedrock enables enterprises to deploy GenAI without managing infrastructure  
- Agentic AI is the future for enterprise automation  
- Bedrock Agent Core simplifies creating, managing, and scaling AI agents  

### Applying to Work

- Use Zero shot, Few shot, and Chain of thought to improve prompting quality  

### Event Experience

Attending the event provided a fresh perspective on building modern AI systems, from prompting techniques to RAG and agents.  

#### Learning from experts

- Experts explained the architecture of prompting, embedding, and RAG clearly  
- Real-world case studies demonstrated enterprises using GenAI for operations and automation  

#### Hands-on demonstrations

- Live demo of building a Generative AI chatbot using Bedrock  

#### Lessons learned

- Good prompting determines output quality  
- Agentic AI is essential for advanced automation  
- Bedrock Agent Core enables building strong, secure, and scalable agents  

> The event broadened my perspective on GenAI, especially the usefulness of intelligent AI agents and applying them to enterprise workflows.
